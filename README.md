## How To Use 

Starter with a Coming Soon site ready for immediate load onto new wave static site hosts such as <a href='https://www.netlify.com/'>netlify.com</a>

```gatsby new https://github.com/itstechupnorth/gatsby-starter-coming-soon```

## Features

* 404 is also Coming Soon
* No sourcemaps for quick upload
* typography for easy themes
* Upload size less than 400k uncompressed

## Why Another Minimal Starter...?

Gatsby plays well with new wave static site hosts such as <a href='https://www.netlify.com/'>netlify.com</a>

A fat, fully featured site means a slower cycle waiting for content to be updated. Use this **Coming Soon** starter to quickly get a site up and running so that DNS and SSL can be sorted out whilst you work on your content.
